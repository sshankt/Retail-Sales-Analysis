# 🛍️ Retail Sales Data Analysis
### 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Retail Sales Data using Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib) to uncover customer behavior, product performance, and revenue insights.
The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and contains details about transactions, customers, and products.

The goal is to clean, process, and visualize the data to answer key business questions and provide actionable insights.

## 📂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains the following columns:

Transaction ID → Unique identifier for each transaction

Date → Purchase date

Customer ID → Unique customer identifier

Gender → Customer gender (Male/Female)

Age → Customer age

Product Category → Category of the purchased product

Quantity → Number of items purchased

Price per Unit → Price of each product

Total Amount → Total transaction value (Quantity × Price per Unit)

### 🔍 Steps Performed

Data Cleaning & Preparation

Handled missing values (if any)

Converted Date column to datetime format

Extracted Year, Month, and Day for time-based analysis

Removed unnecessary columns

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Using pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib, performed analysis on:

Customer demographics (Age & Gender)

Product performance (most sold categories, revenue contributors)

Time-based trends (monthly/yearly sales)

Customer purchase behavior

### Data Visualization
Created plots for:

Gender distribution (bar chart)

Age group analysis

Top product categories

Monthly revenue trends

Quantity vs. Total Amount

## 📊 Key Insights

✨ From the analysis, we found:

Gender Distribution → Female customers purchased slightly more than male customers.

Age Factor → Majority of buyers fall between 25–40 years, making them the most valuable customer group.

Top Product Categories → Certain categories (like Electronics & Clothing) contribute the highest sales.

Revenue Growth → Sales show seasonal spikes, especially in festival months.

Customer Loyalty → Some customers frequently purchase, contributing significantly to revenue.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Python

pandas → Data cleaning & analysis

NumPy → Numerical operations

matplotlib → Data visualization

📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data analysis can provide business insights such as identifying top-performing products, understanding customer behavior, and detecting seasonal sales trends.
Such insights can help businesses improve marketing strategies, inventory planning, and customer targeting.
